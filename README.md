# Why-not-Mexico
## 1. Noise 
Sometimes you need to find a quiet place and focus on work, unfortunately in Mexico this is difficult to do. Noise rate is a national problem, recently they have approved [tougher penalties](https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/mexico-city-penalties-for-noise/) for exceeding levels.
> Teresa Ramos Arreola, head of the Congressâ€™ environment committee, described noise as a public health problem that can cause sleep disorders, stress, anxiety, depression and neurosis, and exacerbate some cardiovascular conditions.

## 2. Air

## 4. No pedicure salons 
Sad but true, wearing sandals is considered a lower class prerogative. So a good salon where you can get your nails done is hard to find.

## 5. Save your mom's nerves
Explaining to grandma what do you do for a living is a challenge, but have you tried convincing your family you are going to Mexico to work and it is for a narco cartel? God forbid they did  watch Breaking bad or Ozark. A cartel map for no particular reason.
